Optimizing Earthquake Response Strategies in Kadıköy, Istanbul using OSM-based Geospatial data.

# Context

My collaboration with the brilliant PhD student on a research project to optimize earthquake response strategies in Kadıköy, Istanbul, Turkey, by leveraging geospatial logistics, considering travel impedances and road collapse potential.

The central goal was to identify optimal locations for Warehouse and Transportation Facilities (WTF) based on Emergency Earthquake Assembly Areas (EAA) designated by Turkish authorities in Kadıköy. Leveraging the power of Geographic Information Systems (GIS), we harnessed the detailed road network data from OpenStreetMap (OSM) to automate distance calculations and integrate them with ArcGIS Network Analysis tools.

In our comprehensive analysis, we considered travel impedances to prioritize road networks that would offer quicker access and efficient routes during emergency situations. Additionally, we incorporated a vital factor: the collapse potential of roads, to favor and allocate WTFs near roads that are less likely to collapse after an earthquake, ensuring uninterrupted access to affected areas.

I also extend my sincere gratitude to Umut Deniz Kaya, for entrusting me with this significant role in their research project. Our collaboration exemplified the power of GIS technology in addressing complex challenges and contributing to disaster preparedness.
